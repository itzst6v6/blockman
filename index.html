            <h2>The Full, Unfiltered Story.</h2>
            <p>This isn't some noble project. This is the result of a complete mess that I had a part in. In some ways, this whole thing has ruined my life, and I'm done with it.</p>
            <p>It started with trades I made for apps. Then my friend, <strong>Gytis</strong>, gave me the server engine. <strong>He was never supposed to give it to me,</strong> and in doing so, he betrayed our other friend, <strong>Vasu</strong>. By accepting the files, I was part of that betrayal. I'm not hiding from that.</p>
            <p>I was naive and made a YouTube video about the 2020 engine. The chaos was instant. The fallout was fast. I was banned from Vasu's Discord project, <strong>'BlockyVerse'</strong>, which was his own server for the 2020 engine. That was the final straw.</p>
            <p>The whole problem was that these engines were <strong>rare</strong>. That rarity is what people used for power. After the ban, I decided to destroy the one thing they cared about: the secrecy. I turned my server into a <strong>No Rules, Free Admin Land,</strong> and leaked the conversations back to Vasu. Now, I'm ending it for good by making these files public. If they aren't rare anymore, they can't be used as a weapon. The power trip is over.</p>

            <p><strong>Important Notice:</strong> The files offered here are <strong>precompiled</strong>. You are downloading ready-to-run game clients and servers, not the source code.</p>
            <p>These precompiled versions work perfectly on Windows 11. However, to compile the engines from scratch, you would need the original source code (not included here) and would have to run Windows 10.</p>

            <h2>Why I Can't Help Anymore</h2>
            <p>I need to be very clear about this: I have quit. The files are here for you to use, but my involvement ends now.</p>
            <p>The amount of stress, drama, and personal problems this whole situation has caused is more than I'm willing to handle. Answering questions, troubleshooting bugs, and helping with setups just keeps me tied to a past I need to move on from. It's a massive mental drain.</p>
            <p>This project is now fully in the hands of the community. You have the files. It's up to you to learn, experiment, and help each other. I've given you the tools, but I can no longer be the support line. I need to get my life back.</p>
