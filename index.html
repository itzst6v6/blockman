            <h2>The Full, Unfiltered Story.</h2>

            <h3>Gytis's Mistake (How It Started)</h3>
            <p>Let's be clear: <strong>I didn't start this, but I'm going to finish it.</strong> The person who kicked this all off was my friend, <strong>Gytis.</strong> He made a dumb decision. For some apps—yes, really, just for some apps—he gave me the server engine. He was never supposed to give it to me, and that single act was a betrayal of our other friend, <strong>Vasu.</strong> That's how it all began.</p>

            <h3>My Reaction (How I Ended It)</h3>
            <p>Now, my part. I'm not innocent. I accepted the files, which made me part of the betrayal. My mistake was being naive and making a YouTube video about the 2020 engine. The chaos was instant. The fallout was fast. I was banned from Vasu's Discord project, <strong>'BlockyVerse'</strong>, for the video.</p>
            <p>That was the final straw. The whole problem was that these engines were <strong>rare</strong>. That rarity is what people used for power. After the ban, I decided to destroy the one thing they cared about: the secrecy. I turned my server into a <strong>No Rules, Free Admin Land,</strong> and leaked the conversations back to Vasu. Now, I'm ending it for good by making these files public. If they aren't rare anymore, they can't be used as a weapon. The power trip is over.</p>

            <p>These precompiled versions work perfectly on Windows 11. However, to compile the engines from scratch, you would need the original source code (not included here) and would have to run Windows 10.</p>

            <!-- UPDATED THIS SECTION -->
            <h2>My Brain Is Now Smoother Than a Bowling Ball</h2>
            <p>So you clicked. Welcome to the epilogue. Let's be brutally honest: after everything that happened, I have approximately <strong>negative five (-5) remaining braincells</strong> to dedicate to this project. Each question about "how 2 run srerver" has physically chipped away a piece of my sanity. This whole drama over a broken old block game has been a one-way ticket to burnout city.</p>
            <p>For a while, I tried to help. I really did. But my DMs turned into a cursed tech support hotline. My inbox is a graveyard of questions like:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"How do I unzip this?"</li>
                <li>"Where is the download button?" (It's right there.)</li>
                <li>"Why isn't the engine labeled BRICKED working?"</li>
                <li>"Can you add the new battle pass to the 2020 version?"</li>
                <li>"My PC exploded is it a virus?"</li>
                <li>"Can you teach me how to code an entire MMO from scratch?"</li>
                <li>"The server isn't working." (No other information given.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's like being the only IT guy for a school of people who try to drink from the bottom of the cup. The amount of mental energy I've spent is non-refundable. My brain's warranty has expired. I am a husk.</p>
            <p>So, this project is now fully and completely open-source in spirit. <strong>It's your problem now, lol.</strong> You have the files. You have the tools. The rest is up to you, the community. Figure it out. Help each other. Start a wiki, a Discord, a smoke signal service, I don't care.</p>
            <p>My watch has ended. I have given you the keys to the car. Do not ask me for driving lessons, where to get gas, or how to change a tire. I'm going to go touch grass and try to remember what the sun looks like.</p>
